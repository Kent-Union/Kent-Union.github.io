Despite this, it's easier to just resend it: Go to the specific transaction page on SUMS (e.g. /finance/transactions/view/{transaction_ID}) Click Email Check the address within the Recipient Email Address field for typos or amend to a different email address (e.g. a university email instead of their personal one) Click Submit Hello, I have resent your confirmation email to EMAIL, please check your spam/junk folder in case it was accidentally filtered there. Many thanks, Another reason a confirmation email wouldn't have sent is because the payment didn't actually process completely. In these circumstances a student might check their bank account, see money has been taken and assume everything has gone through correctly. In actual fact, though money has been taken from their bank account it hasn't actually been processed through to us due to an error. Instead it's held by their bank and refunded back into their account soon afterwards. To see if a transaction didn't process completely: Go to the specific transaction page on SUMS (e.g. /finance/transactions/view/{transaction_ID}) In the top right you'll see either a green Complete tag, an orange Processing tab or a red Cancelled tag This typically happens with international banks or a student inputting the incorrect billing address attached to their bank card.

If the KPasses were bought online: If they were public purchases, you'll need to look through the transaction of the specific KPass If they were purchases made after the student had registered, you should be able to see them under their student profiles in the Active Subscriptions and Transactions sections.

The team at Lincoln will process the refund through WorldPay. It's best to inform the student that a refund has been processed and that the money can take up to 10 working days to reappear in their bank account. A student can't sign in to purchase a KPass The most common reason a student is unable to sign into the Kent Union website is because they didn't opt-in to become a member of Kent Union. Therefore they are not included in the data feed we receive from the university which allows them to sign in. In order to opt-in, they must contact the Central Student Administration Office at the university and explain they would like to be a member of Kent Union Hello, Sorry to hear you are having problems accessing the Kent Union website. It looks as though we haven\u2019t received data for you from the university and that\u2019s what\u2019s preventing you from logging in.

Please could you email the university\u2019s Central Student Administration Office at csao@kent.ac.uk to see if this is the case - if it is they will be able to opt you in. Many thanks, A student is unable to purchase a discounted KPass If a student who should be able to purchased a discounted KPass is unable to, it's typically because they've now got a different student account. For example, the Gold Repurchasers KPass allows students who bought a KPass Gold the previous year to purchase a discounted KPass this year. However the student may have changed course or switched from an undergraduate to a postgraduate which means their current student account is not the one included in the product rule for the Gold Repurchasers KPass. If this is the case, you're able to temporarily reactivate their old student account so they can use it to purchase the discounted KPass and then transfer it to their new account. Go to Members > Search Membership and find both the old and current student accounts The old student account should have an orange Opt In button featuring an arrow Click Action on the pop-up to reactivate the account for 48 hours If a student isn't able to login and purchase the discounted KPass in time, you are able to repeat this process.

We always sell KPasses to students before they've registered during Welcome Week, which means they haven't yet recieved their University of Kent login and we don't yet have their data on SUMS. Therefore, until registration, the KPass prodcucts must only have Public Sales checked. Since a public purchase has no account attached to it, it is vital we add Extra Capture Fields to the product to make it easier when matching public purchases to student account after registration (more information below). After registration when students are able to login to the website, you'll need to go back and switch the product over to Member Sales instead.

Setting up KPass variants Along with the regular full-priced KPass products, Licensed Trade usually want to offer variants of them such as a Gold Repurchasers discounted KPass or a Gold Upgrade KPass for KPass Bronze holders. Whatever the variant, its usually only available to a certain audience which means you'll need to ask Lincoln to create a Product Rule for you. For example, for a Gold Repurchasers discounted KPass you'll need to find all the associated KPass Gold product IDs from the previous year. Send them to the team at Lincoln and ask for a product rule to be set up with any students who bought those product IDs. Once they've done this, you're able to set up the new product. Follow the steps above until you reach Shop Rules where you'll see an Available Rules section with a list of rules available. Find the rule Lincoln created for you and click to activate it. Simple! Setting KPass products as Platinum Products Once you've made a KPass product it's vital you enter its ID in SUMS as a Platinum Product .

To set KPass product as Platinum Products: Take note of all applicable KPass product IDs you've created Go to System Configuration > Settings > Subscriptions In the Platinum Product field enter the product IDs, each seperated by a comma and a space (e.g. 5948, 5950, 5947)","title":"Setting up KPass Products"},{"location":"kpass/product-setup/#setting-up-kpass-products","text":"Our KPass is comprised of many different products available in different places and at different times.
